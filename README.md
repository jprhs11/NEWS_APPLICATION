# News Management & Editorial Portal

## Project Overview
A Django-powered news application designed for modern editorial workflows. This platform features a robust **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system managing the full lifecycle of news—from journalist submission to editorial review and reader publication.

## Key Features & Workflows
*   **Journalist Workflow:** Create, edit, and delete articles/newsletters. *Note: Editing an approved article automatically reverts its status to "Pending" for re-approval.*
*   **Editor Workflow:** Access a dedicated dashboard to Approve, Review, and Edit content. Editors can leave internal review notes for journalists.
*   **Reader Workflow:** Discover authors via directories, manage subscriptions, and view a personalized feed of articles from followed journalists.
*   **Developer API:** A full REST API with JWT authentication for third-party integration or headless operation.
